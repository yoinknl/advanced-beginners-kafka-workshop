This repository contains the "Advanced beginners kafka workshop", an introductory workshop for experienced Java and Spring boot developers.
The goal of the workshop is to familiarize developers with the core concepts of Kafka and provide them with their first hands on experience 
in setting up a local single broker cluster, creating a producer, a consumer and a kafka streams application.

The workshop consists of three different modules:
1. Kafka-producer: An application that sends/publishes data to Kafka
2. Kafka-consumer: An application that reads/consumes data from Kafka
3. Kafka-streams: An application that streams data from and to Kafka.

The single broker cluster can be started using docker-compose. The explanation for starting the cluster can be found in the exercises folder 
in the file "00 - Set up.md". The other files in the exercises folder contain the explanation on how to create a producer, consumer and 
streams application.

Enjoy the workshop!
